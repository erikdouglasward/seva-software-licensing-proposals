software practices and licensing practices that follow the principles of sustainability and vegan lifestyle. I have experience living in the northwestern parts of the United States. I'm very excited to bring Grass Roots, sustainable and ethical style principles to vegan developing.
## EeshvarDasIKCM experience in grassroots sustainability using austerity and tolerance.
when I was living in Seattle between the years 2005 and 2007, I depleted my use of machines down to public transportation, kitchen appliances, apartment lighting, and wall outlets that were largely used for operating my electronic music equipment.
I used One of the very last flip phones in existence before the mobile device conquered the flip phone entirely.
I went as far in austerity to destroy the LCD screen on the flip phone.
I replaced the LCD screen by creating a small pocket using tape.
inside that pocket, I put a step by step guide on how to press the flip phone buttons for basic phone operation.
these austerities helped me to ground my understanding of what it takes to be at the most rudimentary understanding of what will be required to progress the sustainability movement.
Seattle is a great city for utilizing austerities and moving towards sustainable practices like this.
